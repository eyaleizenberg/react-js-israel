# React Native app for React.js Israel 
Here is my github project for todays presentation. This app shows React JS Israel's events and information. 
The 'getting_off_the_ground' branch is pretty much where I started the presentation. The 'master' branch is where we finished (with just a bit of clean up).
If you want to test out your React Native skills, feel free to create pull requests to this repo and maybe we can make a nice React.js Israel app! 

In the routes.js file, change <YOU API KEY GOES HERE> to your actual API key from meetup.com
